TS (JS with type checking) is created by Microsoft to address the shortcomings of JS.
Benefits:
- Static typing
- Code completion
- Refactoring
- Shorthand notation

Drawbacks:
- Compilation
- Discipline in coding


Compiling with:
tsc index.ts

Creating a TypeScript config file:
tsc --init
You can change the target to esnext, es2020, es2015, etc.


Now we can just type `tsc` to compile the TS files.
